# less-themeify
Generate a stylesheet from a LESS file that contains only theme information (colours etc.)

This library allows you to generate CSS from the a given `.less` file that only contains rules and selectors 
that contain theme information (i.e. colours). Particularly useful if you want to have a default `.less` file
for all users, but also several theme variants that simply change colours for various parts of the interface.
